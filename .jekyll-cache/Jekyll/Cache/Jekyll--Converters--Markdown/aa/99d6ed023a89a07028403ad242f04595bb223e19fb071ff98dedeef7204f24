<center><h1> About Chart my health</h1></center>

<p>Chart my health was developed from the idea of Professor JS Bamrah CBE, a seniort NHS Consultant Psychiatrist and previous Medical Director of Manchester Mental Health and Social Care NHS Trust. Professor Bamrah identified a need to improve the support of patients with mental illness and empower them to monitor and manage their physical health to minimise the risks associated with their condition and improve health outcomes. 
Based on Prof Bamrah‚Äôs idea, Chart my health has been created through a Joint Working collaboration, established in December 2017, involving 4 core working group  partners:</p><br />

<ul>
    <li>NHS Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust</li>
    <li>Janssen-Cilag Ltd.</li>
    <li>The Apperta Foundation</li>
    <li>ReThink Mental Illness</li>
</ul>

<p>The group worked with the application development company ‚ÄòStaircase13‚Äô to produce the final application.</p><br />

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care defines Joint Working as ‚ÄúSituations where, for the benefit of patients, one or more pharmaceutical companies, the NHS and others (e.g. Patient Groups) pool skills, experience and/or resources for the joint development and implementation of patient-centred projects and share a commitment to successful delivery. Joint working agreements and management arrangements are conducted in an open and transparent manner. Joint working differs from sponsorship, where pharmaceutical companies simply provide funds for a specific event or work programme‚Äù.</p><br />

<p>Each of the working group partners continue to support the delivery of Chart my health and are committed to its successful outcomes.</p><br />

<p>If you would like any further information regarding the development of Chart my health and/or the role of each Joint Working group member please contact:  <a href="mailto:info@apperta.org">info@apperta.org</a></p><br />
